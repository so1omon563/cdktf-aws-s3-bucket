# TODO

- Allow for reading in the required variables without having to hard code the file name in the script

- Allow for passing in the required variables via the command line or environment variables (terraform style) - see the .old files for examples

- Allow for setting default tags in a way that isn't hardcoded.

- Allow for setting additional tags from the default tags

- Allow for creating the backend bucket and DynmoDB table if they do not exist
